SHRDAA

Secure High-Integrity Registry for Data Audit & Authentication

SHRDAA is a blockchain-inspired system designed to bring transparency, traceability, and accountability to government fund management. The goal is simple: make public fund allocation tamper-proof, auditable, and verifiable in real time.

📌 Vision

Public financial systems often suffer from opacity, delayed audits, and potential manipulation. SHRDAA introduces a secure digital registry that ensures:

Immutable transaction records

Transparent fund flow tracking

Cryptographically verifiable audits

Reduced risk of corruption

High-integrity data authentication

This project aims to serve as a foundation for future GovTech solutions focused on financial transparency.

⚙️ Core Features

Secure Ledger System – Every transaction is recorded in a tamper-resistant structure.

Audit Trail Generation – Complete historical tracking of fund movement.

Authentication Layer – Role-based access control for issuing, approving, and auditing entities.

Data Integrity Verification – Hash-based validation to prevent unauthorized changes.

Modular Architecture – Designed for scalability and future integration.

🧠 How It Works

Funds are issued by authorized authorities.

Each allocation or transfer is recorded in the system.

Transactions are cryptographically hashed and linked.

Auditors can verify fund movement through immutable records.

Any attempt to alter past records invalidates the chain integrity.
