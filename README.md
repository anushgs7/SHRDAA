# SHRDAA

## Secure High‑Integrity Registry for Data Audit & Authentication

SHRDAA is a blockchain-inspired fund tracking and auditing system designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and data integrity in government financial workflows.

The system provides a tamper-resistant registry where every fund allocation and transaction is securely recorded, verified, and auditable.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To build a secure, high-integrity digital registry that:

* Tracks public fund allocation and transfers
* Prevents unauthorized data modification
* Enables transparent auditing
* Maintains cryptographic data integrity
* Reduces dependency on manual verification systems

---

## 🧠 System Overview

SHRDAA works by recording transactions in a structured, hash-linked format similar to a blockchain ledger.

1. Authorized entities issue or allocate funds.
2. Each transaction is recorded in the registry.
3. Transactions are hashed to preserve integrity.
4. Records are linked to prevent tampering.
5. Auditors can verify the full transaction history.

Any attempt to alter historical data invalidates the integrity of the chain.
